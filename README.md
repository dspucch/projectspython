# projectsjava
My personal projects.
Brand new to writing Python. This is a directory for my work/projects to build a personal profile and to show my knowledge. Also looking for any help and support along the way.
I am currently working on my Bachelors in Cyber Security and have a concentration with Data Analytics. I would love to learn Python for data analysis and to use it in my Cyber Security career.
Any help/knowledge would be greatly appreciated!
